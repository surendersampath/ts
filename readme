# PCB Design Project

This project involves the design and implementation of a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). 

## Project Description

This project aims to design a PCB for a specific application. The design process involves schematic capture, PCB layout and routing, and finally, fabrication and assembly.

## Installation 

To view and modify the PCB design files, you will need to install a PCB design software. We recommend using [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/), an open-source electronics design automation suite.

## Usage/Examples

Open the `.sch` file in the KiCad's Eeschema to view the schematic. The `.kicad_pcb` file can be opened in Pcbnew to view the PCB layout.
